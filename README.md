- **NextJS**: one the best tool at the moment to create full-stack Web applications

- **Git Flow**: Git flow is used to separate each branch responsabilities. Its a powerfull way to clean and facilitate the delivery process (cf: https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.fr_FR.html)
- **Git Action**: A powerfull CI/CD system
- **AWS EC2**: A powerfull cloud service, which is very usefull to focus only on develop/deploy and ignore hardware part.
