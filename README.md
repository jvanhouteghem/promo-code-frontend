# promo-code-frontend

## Architecture & technical choices:
- **NextJS**: one the best tool at the moment to create full-stack Web applications
- **Tailwind**: Why tailwind is not used? (cf: https://blog.shimin.io/why-i-dont-use-tailwind-in-production/#:~:text=Tailwind%20forces%20an%20extra%20HTML,bunch%20of%20new%20class%20names)
- **Git Flow**: Git flow is used to separate each branch responsabilities. Its a powerfull way to clean and facilitate the delivery process (cf: https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.fr_FR.html)
