# Promo Code API

⚠️ Warning: Api is mocked.
For the moment data is an array of promoCodes stored in a javascript variable in backend side.

CRUD is working, but the data will not persist if the app restart.

## How to use it ?
Use it like regular backend, for example to get promo codes, do a ```GET``` to ```localhost:3000/api/promo-code```.
